# ELITEFX PROGRAM BOARD

> **Single Source of Truth ya GOVERNANCE.** Chief Quant + Implementer wanaisoma
> HII kwanza kabla ya kuendelea. Ndani: Chief Memory · Project Status · Research
> Ledger · Doctrine Amendments · Approval Log. Doctrine ya kina iko
> `ELITEFX_DOCTRINE_V5.2.md`; board hii ndiyo state ya mradi.
>
> Workflow (lazima, hakuna kuruka): **Research → Report → Chief Review →
> APPROVED/REJECTED → PROGRAM_BOARD update → Next Phase.**
> Kila kitu: *Evidence → Finding → Doctrine → Approval.* Hakuna "nafikiri" /
> "inaonekana".

## Approved Findings

**[F-001] Market States Exist**
Status: APPROVED
Evidence: `market_state_report.md`

**[F-002] State Persistence Exists**
Status: APPROVED
Evidence: `market_state_report.md`

**[F-003] State Age Matters**
Status: APPROVED
Evidence: `state_age_report.md`

**[F-004] State Age Improves Calibration**
Status: APPROVED
Evidence: `state_transition_model_report.md`
Note: age ni **calibrator**, sio predictor (accuracy flat, ECE ↓).

**[F-005] Context Improves Event Quality**
Status: APPROVED
Evidence: `context_value_report.md` *(full-metric re-run pending; matokeo ya
awali: `state_context_value_report.md`, run ya Japhet 2026-06-23)*
Note (uaminifu wa ledger): faida ni **EV-SELECTION, sio prediction** —
median ΔEV chanya (vol +1.26 / spr +0.67 / act +0.59 pips), lakini ΔLogLoss ≈ 0
(P(win) haibadiliki). Hii inaunga mkono Principle 12 (Context = filter). Robustness
inajaribiwa Phase 1.95.

---

## Rejected Findings

**[R-001] Activity carries most predictive information**
Status: REJECTED
Reason: Phase 1.8 disproved (Activity = ΔLogLoss ndogo zaidi +2.2%, accuracy ndogo zaidi).
Evidence: `state_transition_model_report.md`
Replacement: *Activity shows strong state-memory but lower predictability;
volatility and spread provide more stable predictive structure.*
(Conflated Signal Strength ↔ Predictability.)

## Current Phase

Phase: **1.95**
Name: **Context Generalization Test**
Status: ACTIVE
Owner: Implementer
Chief Approval: YES

---

## Completed Phases

- [✓] Phase 0    Data Validation
- [✓] Phase 1    State Engine
- [✓] Phase 1.5  Transition Engine
- [✓] Phase 1.6  State Age
- [✓] Phase 1.7  Context Engine
- [✓] Phase 1.8  Transition Model
- [✓] Phase 1.9  Context Value

---

## Next Phase Queue

- [ ] Phase 1.95  Context Generalization   *(ACTIVE — engine ready, report pending data run)*
- [ ] Phase 2     Adaptive Volume Bars      *(design APPROVED, no ML — engine ready, report pending data run)*
- [ ] Phase 3     Event Diagnostics
- [ ] Phase 4     Event × Context Matrix
- [ ] Phase 5     Triple Barrier
- [ ] Phase 6     Outcome Engine
- [ ] Phase 7     Lifecycle Controller

## Open Questions

**Q-001 — Does Context improve more than one Event Family?**
Status: OPEN
Needed: Breakout, Mean Reversion
Owner: Phase 1.95

**Q-002 — Do Volume Bars improve signal quality?**
Status: OPEN
Needed: Phase 2

## Doctrine Amendment Log

- 2026-06-23 — V5.2 created (Context first-class; STATE→AGE→TRANSITION→EVENT).
- 2026-06-23 — Age = CALIBRATOR (sio predictor). Finding F amended (R-001).
- 2026-06-23 — Principle 03: Context must prove trading relevance (Prediction ≠ Economic Value).
- 2026-06-23 — Principle 12: **Context Is A Filter** (sio alpha source).

## Approval Log

| Date | Item | Decision | By |
|------|------|----------|-----|
| 2026-06-23 | V5.2 doctrine + amendments 1–4 | APPROVED | Chief Quant |
| 2026-06-23 | Age = calibrator; H-01 rejected | APPROVED | Chief Quant |
| 2026-06-23 | F-005 Context improves event quality | APPROVED | Chief Quant |
| 2026-06-23 | Phase 1.95 Context Generalization | APPROVED (start) | Chief Quant |
| 2026-06-23 | Phase 2 Adaptive Volume Bars (design, no ML) | APPROVED (start) | Chief Quant |

### Still BLOCKED (Chief approval required)

- Triple Barrier
- LightGBM
- Random Forest
- Outcome Model

Reason: *Hatutaki ML kutafuta alpha kabla market structure haijathibitishwa.*

---

*Governance kuanzia 2026-06-23: hakuna phase inayoanza bila Chief Approval
hapa juu; hakuna hypothesis iliyokataliwa (Rejected Findings) kurudiwa; doctrine
moja rasmi = V5.2.*
